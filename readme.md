> As a designer, you're interested in creating a functional, attractive
> layout for the site. The major concern here is not how to create
> content, configure the site or perform heavy- duty programming tasks.
>
> This section shows how to create responsive web pages that display
> well in any device, design master pages customize the look and feel of
> the entire site and create templates for widgets and pages.
>
> The section ends with a look at the Sitefinity Feather Module, a
> modern, convention- based framework for creating clean,
> mobile-friendly layouts in a simplified manner.
